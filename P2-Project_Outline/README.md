## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be an event listing that will enable community members and small business owners the ability to promote and track events that they offer. It will grant users login capabilities, the ability to create, edit and delete particulars (e.g. title, description, location, time/date, etc.), also due to COVID-19 protocols members will be required to disclose what measures will be taken to ensure the saftey of staff and participants. 

The motivation behind my project is an under resourced community that needs a way to access information about services and events offered locally.

### Features
* User login: Users will have the ability to login by way of registering an account by way of using a third-party authentication provider(e.g. ASP.Net Authentication). Guest users will be able to view events but all other access will be restricted to users with an account.

* Create and edit events: Users will have the ability to create new events in the system. Users will enter data into the required fields such as title, date/time, location, etc.

* Guest Users: Guest users are users without a registered account. These users will be able to view a list of current events but will not posses the ability to create, edit or delete said events.

* COVID-19 Protocols: During this tumultuous time around the globe we have to do everything possible to safeguard ourselves from this deadly virus. Users will be able to disclose any information about the measures that they are taking to ensure the saftey of staff and participants at a given event or location.

* Delete events: Users will have the ability to delete events.
